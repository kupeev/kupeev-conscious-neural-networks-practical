### In Brief

#### What are CONNs?

The networks approximate several properties of human consciousness:

* iterative process, and not one-pass forward processing
* multiprocessing
* personalization

The network operate with high level representation which may interpreted as **what the network currently sees.**

#### How the CONNs may be used?

* high interpretability
* probably, high resiliance to adversatrial attacks
* by using "the seen by the CONN network" we may do many ...
* conglomeration of CONNs allows simulation of social conciousbness.

For example, given A and B, 90% members of a collective prefer A.
The CONNs allows to estimate stabiliti of thie preference. For, example, whether after a small impact, 95% of a collective will prefer B. 

#### The Program

* Build a simplest CONN network. 
V, see [4]
* Describe approach for CONNs construction:
  * VIS
  * NLP
* Algorithm for CONN conglomeration
* Creation of Cocial Game exploring CONNs
